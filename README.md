  paymentStatus: string, // For paid plans
  courses: array // Enrolled courses
}
```

### Course Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  price: number,
  duration: string,
  progress: number, // 0-100%
  resources: array // Learning materials
}
```

### Forum Model
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  content: string,
  author: string,
  category: string,
  date: string,
  replies: array,
  views: number,
  likes: number
}
```

## Controller Implementation

The application controllers are implemented as JavaScript modules:

## Disclaimer

This application is a demonstration project for educational purposes. 
It is not intended for production use without proper security implementations, 
especially regarding user authentication and data protection.

Important considerations for production use:
- Implement proper server-side authentication
- Use secure password hashing algorithms
- Add CSRF protection for forms
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Add proper database persistence instead of localStorage
- Implement rate limiting and security headers
- Conduct thorough security testing before deployment

The cryptocurrency payment functionality is for demonstration purposes only 
and should not be used for actual financial transactions without proper 
payment processing integration and compliance with financial regulations.
