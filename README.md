## Model Implementation

### Data Storage Architecture

The application uses browser LocalStorage to simulate a text file-based storage system:

```javascript
// Example data structure for user accounts
{
  id: "user_timestamp_random",
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  username: "johndoe",
  password: "hashed_password",
  accountType: "student",
  accountPlan: "free",
  progress: {
    english: 75,
    japanese: 40,
    math: 90
  },
  badges: ["language_learner", "math_whiz"],
  joinDate: "2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Disclaimer

This is a demonstration website for educational purposes. 
All institution names, contact information, and program 
details are fictional. The application uses browser LocalStorage 
for data persistence, which means all data will be cleared when 
browser cache is cleared. For production use, this would require 
integration with a proper backend database system.

The cryptocurrency payment functionality is for demonstration 
purposes only and does not process real transactions. No real 
financial transactions occur through this application.

The chatbot provides predefined responses based on keyword matching 
and does not use artificial intelligence or machine learning technologies.
